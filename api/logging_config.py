      - Set the root logger's level explicitly too: basicConfig() does nothing
        when a server or test runner has already installed handlers.
      - Preserve existing handlers; do not use force=True.

    Module loggers inherit this configuration through normal propagation. The
    logging exercise runs entry operations at INFO and DEBUG to compare output.
    Never log journal text, settings objects, or credentials.
